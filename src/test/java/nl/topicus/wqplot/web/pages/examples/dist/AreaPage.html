	<p>Area charts support highlighting and mouse events by default. The
	options and handlers and callbacks are essentially the same as with bar,
	pie, donut and funnel charts. One notable exception for area charts is
	that no data point index will be provided to the callback and the entire
	data set for the highlighted area will be returned. This is because the
	area is not associated with one particular data point, but with the
	entire data set of the series.</p>
	
	<div><span>Moused Over: </span><span wicket:id="info1b">Nothing</span></div>
	
	<div wicket:id="chart1b" class="plot"
		style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>
	
	<p>For the chart below, mouseover has been disabled and click
	handling is enabled by setting "highlightMouseDown: true". For
	"fillToZero" area charts that have both negative and positive values as
	shown below, clicking in either the positive of negative regions will
	generate the same result.</p>
	
	<div><span>You Clicked: </span><span wicket:id="info1c">Nothing
	yet</span></div>
	
	<div wicket:id="chart1c" class="plot"
